###Theoretical Assignment###

1.	Explain in detail about storage class. Write in detail about 4 different storage class.
2.	Write one simple example of for-loop. Explain about the steps how it works.
3.	Write one simple example of while-loop. Explain about the steps how it works.
4.	Write a paragraph and an example of each about strlen(), strcpy(), strcat(), strcmp(), strrev().
5.	What is array? How array is different from ordinary variable.
6.	How can you prepare a student mark sheets software using the things you’ve learned till now? Give me the list of the things you’ve learned and how can you use it to do what kind of operation to prepare a mark sheet of a student.



###Practical Assignment###

1.	WAP a program to read n numbers from user and store in an array and then rearrange the array in the reverse order.
2.	WAP a program to read n numbers in an array and remove the duplicate numbers from the array.
3.	WAP a program to read two arrays and merge these two arrays into third array.
4.	WAP to merge two sorted arrays in another array in a sorted order.
5.	WAP to input any 10 numbers in an array and find out the Maximum and Minimum Value.
6.	WAP in C to input any 10 numbers in an array and search an element. 

7.	WAP in C to input 10 numbers and find out even and odd. After finding, please do add odd numbers only and even numbers only separately and display it.
8.	WAP to find transpose of a given Matrix
9.	WAP to find whether the given string is palindrome or not. 

10.	WAP to input a string and convert it into upper case and vice versa. 

11.	Write a program to read a string and search a specified word in given string. (use function strstr() ) 

12.	WAP in C to take input M*N from user and find a row sum and column sum

###Eg:
|    |    |    |
|----|----|----|
| 2 | 4 | 6 |
| 98 | 88 | 186 |
| 100 | 92 |  |


###Arrays and Strings:###

1.	WAP in C to initialize any 10 value in an array and display them. 

2.	WAP to input any 10 number by user and display them. 

3.	WAP in C to input any 10 number in an array and print them along with the Total and 
average of that numbers. 

4.	WAP in C to input any 10 numbers in an array and count no. of ODD and EVEN and find 
out their sum and display them. 

5.	WAP in C to input any 10 numbers in an array and search an element. 

6.	WAP to input any 10 numbers in an array and find out the Maximum and Minimum Value.
7.	WAP in C to convert decimal number to Binary, Octal, and Hexadecimal using array. 

8.	WAP to input any 5 elements in an array and print them in reverse order too.

###Arrays and Strings###
1.	Write a Program in C to input any 10 elements in an array and display them using function. (Passing individual array element).

2.	Write a program in c to input any 10 number in an array and sort them in ascending order using function. (Pass Whole array). 

3.	Write a program in c to input any 10 number in an array and sort them in descending order using function. (Pass Whole array).


###Character array and String### 
1.	WAP to input and output of String using Scanf() and Printf(). 

2.	WAP to input and output of String using gets() and Puts(). 

3.	WAP to input and output of Character array using getchar() and Putchar(). 

4.	WAP to input and string and find out the length of string using strlen() and without 
using strlen(). 

5.	WAP to copy a string from one to another using strcpy() and without using strcpy(). 

6.	WAP to concatenate two string using strcat() and without using strcat(). 

7.	WAP to compare two string using strcmp() and without using Strcmp(). 

8.	WAP to reverse a string using strrev() and without using strrev(). 

9.	WAP to find whether the given string is palindrome or not. 

10.	WAP to input the name of any five student and sort them alphabetically in ascending 
order. 

11.	WAP to input a string and convert it into upper case and vice versa. 

12.	WAP to take the string using gets(), and pass to the function to find and return number 
of words, whitespace in that string. 

13.	Write a program to read a string and search a specified word in given string.
